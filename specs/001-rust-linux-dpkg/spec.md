# Feature Specification: Unified Linux Package Manager

**Feature Branch**: `001-rust-linux-dpkg`  
**Created**: 2025年9月9日火曜日  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Rustで制作されるプロジェクトです。 Linux用のパッケージマネージャーです。dpkg, rpm, pacmanなどの、既存のシステム用のパッケージマネージャーや、snap, flatpak, ipak(ipakは私が自作したunsandboxedなローカルアプリケーションをmanagementするためのパッケージマネージャー)などのパッケージマネージャーをすべて統合的に管理することができるようにしたいです。"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Linux user, I want to manage all my installed packages from various package managers (dpkg, rpm, pacman, snap, flatpak, ipak) through a single, unified interface, so that I can simplify package management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have packages installed via dpkg, rpm, and snap, **When** I use the unified package manager to list all installed packages, **Then** I should see a consolidated list of packages from all these sources.
2. **Given** I want to install a new package, **When** I use the unified package manager to install it, **Then** the package should be installed using the appropriate underlying package manager.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a package exists in multiple underlying package managers?
- How does the system handle conflicts or versioning issues between different package managers?
- What happens if an underlying package manager is not installed or configured correctly?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a unified interface for managing packages from dpkg, rpm, pacman, snap, flatpak, and ipak.
- **FR-002**: System MUST be able to list all installed packages from all integrated package managers.
- **FR-003**: System MUST be able to install packages using the appropriate underlying package manager.
- **FR-004**: System MUST be able to update packages using the appropriate underlying package manager.
- **FR-005**: System MUST be able to remove packages using the appropriate underlying package manager.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear feedback on the status of package operations (e.g., success, failure, in progress).
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle errors gracefully when interacting with underlying package managers.
- **FR-008**: System MUST be developed in Rust.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Package**: Represents a software package, with attributes like name, version, source (e.g., dpkg, snap), and status (installed, available).
- **Package Manager**: Represents an underlying package management system (e.g., dpkg, rpm, snap), with capabilities for listing, installing, updating, and removing packages.
